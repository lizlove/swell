# Swell Challenge

Task:
Build a simple landing page (see attached screenshot) that demonstrates the following:
- Semantic HTML
- Responsive CSS
- Javascript

The data to populate the carousel (Tip 1, Tip 2, etc.) can be found in data.json. From that, you'll want to use the image url, heading, and description. You can use any libraries that you feel are appropriate.

The goal is not pixel-perfection, but really to see your rationale behind certain techniques and how you problem solve in building layouts that scale the various window sizes. You don't have to use the exact assets from the layout we sent you, but just recreate it in any frictionless way that show off your coding abilities. Please don't spend more than a few of hours on this, just get the main pieces working, and we can talk through the rest.
